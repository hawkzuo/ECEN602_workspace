This assignment implements the client and server for a chat service.

Team role:
Jianyu Zuo implements the server program. Jimin Wen implements the client program and testing.

Useage:
run make command to lanuch makefile generating executable two files for the project, Client and Server. run make clean to remove all the 
generated object files and executable files from the directory. First lanuch the server and then lanuch
To lanuch the server. The running command follows the pattern: ./server ip_address portnumber max_user_number
To lanuch the client. The running command follows the pattern: ./client username ip_address portnumber


Implementation:
The program contains executable programs on client side and server side. SBCP and readFast are implements to provide functions support for the client and server
programs.

On client side: 
The program first implements input validation, get address information and sends join request to the host. After the connection has been made, the 
client waits for the user input. The input would be sent to server with written method. The received message from the server would be parsed and 
relevant information would be represented on the screen.

On the server side:
The program first implements input validation, get address information and max_user_number, bind the socket to the dedicated port number and listen to the 
socket. Then it listens to file discriptors with select() method. On rereiving new message, the server judges whether it is a new connection from a client 
or a already established client and implements required response. 

Some of Errata:
Server: input arguments error, get address information error, fail to bind server error, error sending the line.
Client: input arguments error, get address information error, fail to connect error, input size exceed error, error sending a line.
