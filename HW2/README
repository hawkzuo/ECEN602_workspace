This assignment implements the client and server for a simple TCP echo
service.

Team role:
Jianyu Zuo implements the server program and read method. Jimin Wen implements the client program and testing.

Useage:
run make command to lanuch makefile generating executable two files for the project, Client and Server. run make clean to remove all the 
generated files from the directory. 
To lanuch the client. The running command follows the pattern: ./Client echos hostname portnumber
To lanuch the server. The running command follows the pattern: ./Server echos portnumber

Implementation:
On client side: 
The program first implements input validation, get address information and connect to the host. After the connection has been made, the 
client waits for the user input. The input would be sent to server with written method. The received message from the server is read via
readFast() in the readFast.c. 

On the server side:
The program first implements input validation, get address information, bind the socket to the dedicated port number and listen to the 
socket. The socket accepts new connection when new request is received. The server read sent message calling recv() method and sends it
back to the client with written().

Errata:
Server: input arguments error, get address information error, fail to bind server error, error sending the line.
Client: input arguments error, get address information error, fail to connect error, input size exceed error, error sending a line,
